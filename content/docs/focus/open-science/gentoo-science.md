# Gentoo Science

Gentoo Science is one of the foremost repositories for scientific software, covering hundreds of packages, and consistently providing rapid access to the newest releases, as seen in [Repology](https://repology.org/repository/gentoo_ovl_science).
It integrates seamlessly with the base package set of Gentoo Linux and can be installed on any Gentoo system with a single command (see repository install instructions [here](https://github.com/gentoo/sci#installation)).

# NeuroGentoo

Since 2016 I have integrated wide-ranging neuroscience support in Gentoo Science, with the initial rationale and project ramp-up described in **Ioanas et al. 2017** ([DOI:10.3897/rio.3.e12095](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e12095)).
Packages include (but far exceed):
* Some of the foremost neuroimaging tools:
    - afni
    - ANTs
    - FSL
    - Nilearn
    - Nipype
* Small animal brain imaging:
    - SAMRI
    - mlebe
* A wide array of data packages for reproducible articles:
    - DARGCC (for [DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118386](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118386))
    - IRSABI (also for [DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118386](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118386))
    - OPFVTA (for [DOI:10.1038/s41398-022-01812-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-01812-5))
* General-purpose data sharing packages with primary use in neuroscience:
